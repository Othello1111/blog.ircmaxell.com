# Keep It Civil

Heated discussions are going to happen, and that's okay! These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people. 

So, remember to avoid:

 * name-calling
 * ad hominem attacks
 * Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
 * knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.

# Spam

Links are completely cool. If you have content that you wrote that you think adds value to a discussion or a post, please share it! 

With that said, commercial content that's not *directly* related (doesn't contribute to the discussion) and unrelated content will be removed.
